<p>
Basic strategy presents the best moves(Hit, Stand, Double, etc.) for a given player's and dealer's hand. Memorizing this alone is not enough to beat the house's edge, but knowing this is essential when trying to beat the dealer.
<br>
This trainer helps players master basic strategy by practicing matching the corresponding plays, given the dealer and their hand. 
<br>

Notes: 
* you are not allowed to surrender
* if your card contains a pair that you don't split
</p>

<p>
Below are the corresponding commands for each play:

    Hit: h
    Stand: s
    Double/or hit: dh
    Double/or stand: ds
    Split: p
    Quit: q or quit
