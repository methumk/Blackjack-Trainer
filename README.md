<p>
Basic strategy aims to allow the player to decide how to play their hand (Hit, Stand, Double, etc.)
This trainer helps players master basic strategy by practicing matching the corresponding plays given the dealer and their hand. 
Note: you are not allowed to surrender
</p>

<p>
Below are the corresponding commands for each play:

    Hit: h
    Stand: s
    Double/or hit: dh
    Double/or stand: ds
    Split: p
    Quit: q or quit
